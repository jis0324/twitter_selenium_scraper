  Jul 4
The Snuggie sold over 30 million units and generated $500 million in revenues. Its cousin, The Slanket, reached almost $10M per year too.

In case you were wondering, a blanket with sleeves has outperformed most venture-backed D2C brands.

Building products, esp architectural masonry. The cost of material and human time to create a cinder block and a paver stone is roughly equivalent. But

Cinder blocks are $1-2. 

Paver stones can be $8-20. 

And you can build and sell both: B2B or B2B2C and B2C respectively.
